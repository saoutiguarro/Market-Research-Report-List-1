<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Auto Night Vision System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active System</li><li>Passive System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Auto Night Vision System market is divided into two main types: active systems and passive systems. Active systems use infrared light sources to illuminate the area, providing clear visibility in complete darkness, which is especially useful in challenging environments. Conversely, passive systems rely on existing ambient light, such as moonlight or streetlights, capturing and amplifying this light to enhance visibility without additional illumination. Both systems serve to improve safety and navigation in low-light conditions, catering to various automotive applications.</p></p>
