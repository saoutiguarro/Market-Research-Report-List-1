<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Large Diameter FRPM Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot Rolled Steel Pipe</li><li>Cold Drawn Pipe</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Large Diameter FRPM (Fiber Reinforced Plastic Mortar) market features two primary types: Hot Rolled Steel Pipe and Cold Drawn Pipe. Hot Rolled Steel Pipes are produced by heating steel above its recrystallization temperature, allowing for malleability and shaping, ideal for large-diameter applications. In contrast, Cold Drawn Pipes are formed at room temperature, which enhances strength and finish but limits size. Both types cater to diverse industrial needs, influencing factors like pressure resistance, durability, and application suitability in various sectors.</p></p>
